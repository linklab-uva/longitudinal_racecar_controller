# Indy Autonomous Challenge AV-21 Longitudinal Controller

## Overview

This repository contains a simplified model-based longitudinal controller designed specifically for the Indy Autonomous Challenge AV-21 car. This controller is intended to provide precise and reliable control over the car's longitudinal motion, ensuring safe and efficient operation during autonomous racing scenarios.

## Features

- **Model-Based Control**: The controller is based on a simplified mathematical model of the AV-21 car's dynamics, allowing for precise control of acceleration and deceleration.

- **Adaptive Behavior**: The controller can adapt to different racing conditions and scenarios, making it suitable for a wide range of track layouts and environmental conditions.

- **Safety Measures**: Robust safety measures are integrated to ensure the AV-21 car operates within safe limits, preventing collisions and maintaining stability.

- **Real-Time Feedback**: The controller utilizes real-time sensor data, such as GPS, lidar, and camera inputs, to make informed decisions and adjust the car's speed accordingly.

- **Open Source**: This project is open-source, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the autonomous racing community to improve and enhance the controller's capabilities.
